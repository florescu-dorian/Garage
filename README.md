**Features**

Advanced Search and Filtering: Users can easily search for cars based on various criteria, such as make, model, year, and price range, ensuring a tailored browsing experience.
API Integration: Seamless integration of APIs enables users to access a diverse range of cars from various sources, expanding the selection and enhancing the user experience.
Custom UI Components: Carefully crafted custom UI components contribute to a fluid and modern interface, elevating usability and aesthetics.

**Technologies Used**

React: The foundation of the web application, providing dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
Next.js 13: Empowering server-side rendering and seamless navigation between pages for enhanced performance.
TypeScript: Adding static typing to the project for improved code quality and developer productivity.
Tailwind CSS: Utilized for rapid UI development with a focus on utility-first CSS, ensuring consistent styling and responsiveness across devices.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
